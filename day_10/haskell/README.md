## How to Build

To run the solution you need a compiler. I strongly suggest you install [GHCUP](https://www.haskell.org/). After that you can either compile or run the solution interctively. I suggest you do the second. In any case you need to download the input from the website and save it in this folder as `input.txt`. After that just:

```BASH
ghci
:load Main.hs
main
```

And the solutions will be printed in your terminal.
